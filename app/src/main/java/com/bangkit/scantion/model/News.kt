                            "Protect your skin from the sun: Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun is the primary risk factor for melanoma. To minimize your exposure, follow these guidelines:\n\n" +
                            "Seek shade, especially during the peak sun hours between 10 am and 4 pm.\n\n" +
                            "Wear protective clothing, such as long sleeves, pants, wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses with UV protection.\n\n" +
                            "Apply sunscreen with a high SPF (sun protection factor) of 30 or higher, and reapply it every two hours or more frequently if swimming or sweating.\n\n" +
                            "Avoid tanning beds and sunlamps: Artificial sources of UV radiation, such as tanning beds and sunlamps, can increase your risk of melanoma. It's best to avoid them altogether.\n\n" +
                            "Perform regular skin self-exams: Become familiar with your skin and examine it regularly. Look for any changes in moles, freckles, or other spots on your body. If you notice any new or suspicious growths, or existing ones that have changed in size, shape, color, or texture, consult a dermatologist.\n\n" +
                            "Get professional skin examinations: Regularly visit a dermatologist or another healthcare professional for a thorough skin examination. They can identify any potential signs of melanoma that may be difficult for you to detect.\n\n" +
                            "Be cautious of your sun sensitivity: Some people are more sensitive to the sun due to factors like fair skin, light hair, and a family history of skin cancer. If you have increased sun sensitivity, take extra precautions to protect your skin.\n\n" +
                            "Educate yourself about risk factors: Understand the risk factors associated with melanoma, including a personal or family history of the disease, having many moles or atypical moles, and a weakened immune system. If you have any of these risk factors, consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\n" +
                            "Lead a healthy lifestyle: Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can contribute to overall well-being and potentially reduce your risk of cancer. This includes eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, exercising regularly, managing stress, avoiding tobacco products, and limiting alcohol consumption.\n\n" +
                            "Remember that prevention is crucial, but it's also important to detect melanoma early. Regular self-exams and professional skin examinations are essential for early detection and prompt treatment if necessary. If you have concerns about melanoma or notice any suspicious changes in your skin, consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and guidance",
